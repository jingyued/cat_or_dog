## how to run it
Here are the basic steps to run the MVP project from GitHub locally on your machine:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. For example:
   `git clone https://github.com/jingyued/cat_or_dog.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   `cd ../cat_or_dog`
3. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Start the development server:
   `npm start`
This will run the jspsych app in development mode and open up a browser window to view it locally.
